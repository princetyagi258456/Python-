What does [::-1} do?
Ans: [::-1] is used to reverse the order of an array or a sequence.
For example:
1
2
3
	
import array as arr
My_Array=arr.array('i',[1,2,3,4,5])
My_Array[::-1]

Output: array(‘i’, [5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
[::-1] reprints a reversed copy of ordered data structures such as an array or a list. the original array or list remains unchanged.
