Explain split(), sub(), subn() methods of “re” module in Python.
Ans: To modify the strings, Python’s “re” module is providing 3 methods. They are:

split() – uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list.
sub() – finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then replace them with a different string
subn() – it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along with the no. of replacements.
