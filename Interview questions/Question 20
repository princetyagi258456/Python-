How does break, continue and pass work?
Break	Allows loop termination when some condition is met and the control is transferred to the next statement.
Continue	Allows skipping some part of a loop when some specific condition is met and the control is transferred to the beginning of the loop
Pass	Used when you need some block of code syntactically, but you want to skip its execution. This is basically a null operation. Nothing happens when this is executed.
